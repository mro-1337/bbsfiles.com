<P>D. By saying, "just like a book",  A.S.S.I.S.T., Inc. means that the
registered software may be used by any number of people and may be
freely moved from one computer location to another so long as there
is ABSOLUTELY NO POSSIBILITY of it being used at one location while
being used at another. Just like a book that cannot be read by two
different people in two different locations at the same time.</P>
